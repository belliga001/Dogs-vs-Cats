# Dogs-vs-Cats
#### I have developed a very simple webapp that predicts whether the image uploaded by the user is that of a cat or a dog (yes, I have indeed deployed the "hello world" of image classification, so to say XD).

# Accuracies
* On the training data - more than 90%.
* On the test data - more than 90%.

# Deployment
* The webapp has been deployed by using the streamlit services. To have a look for yourself, please go to the link mentioned below.
* The backend and frontend are handled by streamlit as well. Source code for the same is available on this page.

# Development
* Initially, I had used convolutional neural nets with data augmentation to make predictions but the accuracy obtained was nearly 85%.
* For improvement, I have used the VGG16 for transfer learning, with imagenet weights untrainable.
